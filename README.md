# Extract GPX data from the Western Flyer SQLite log database

The log database is nominally generated by the app
[`wf-logger`](https://github.com/westernflyer/wf-logger), although it can also
be obtained from metdata.

It has a schema something like

```sql
CREATE TABLE location_data (timestamp INTEGER NOT NULL UNIQUE PRIMARY KEY, 
            latitude REAL, longitude REAL);
```

Note that it can also contain additional data fields (such as depth), but they
are not used.

To generate a GPX file for Leg 3:

    logger2gpx.py --config leg_3.yaml
