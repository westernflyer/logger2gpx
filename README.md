# Extract GPX data from the Western Flyer log file

The log file is nominally generated by the app [`wf-logger`](https://github.com/westernflyer/wf-logger).
It has a schema something like

```sql
CREATE TABLE archive (timestamp INTEGER NOT NULL UNIQUE PRIMARY KEY, 
            latitude REAL, longitude REAL, depth REAL, distance REAL,
            wind_speed REAL, wind_direction REAL);
```

To generate a GPX file for Leg 3:

    logger2gpx.py --config leg_3.yaml
